== Overview

The Atlanmod-Resource-Server is an attempt to bring collaborative editing to web based EMF editor.
It features 3 endpoint: HTTP REST, WebSocket, Java RMI, and an API based on https://github.com/eclipse-emfcloud/emfcloud-modelserver[EMF.CLOUD modelserver]. Unfortunately, this approach was not successful as it fails to propagate change between users.

Notes: since to the REST api being stateless, some functionalities are not available on this endpoint.
